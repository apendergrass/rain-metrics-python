# rain-metrics-python
Python code to calculate the distribution of rain and metrics described in Pendergrass and Deser 2017

Starting from precipitation data,                                                                                                                                   
1. Calculate the distribution of rain                                                                                                                                     
2. Plot the change from one climate state to another                                                                           

Demo data are included in pdistdemodata.nc 

The rain distribution calculations are based on the Matlab shift-plus-increase-modes-demo.                              

You can read about the methods for calculating the distribution of rain here:

  distribution of rain. Journal of Climate, 27, 8357-8371.

The response to warming is described in:

  of rain frequency and intensity in response to global warming. 
  Journal of Climate, 27, 8372-8383. doi:10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00183.1. 

The rain amount peak, rain frequency peak, rain amount width, and rain frequency width metrics are described in a forthcoming paper (currently being revised) for the Journal of Climate by Pendergrass and Deser.
